## WebP Multi-versioning

Build HTML5 projects to none-WebP and WebP versions(i.e. js files and css files), then dynamically load scripts of different versions according to the browser's WebP capabilities.

This is a demo project. If you want to use this technique, you can take advantage of my ideas, and source code, if needed.

### How to use

- Install Depenencies:

    ```
    npm i
    ```

- Build Project:

    ```
    npm run build
    ```

- Open `dist/index.html`(You might need start a HTTP server) in different browsers to see demo. Or open <https://swenyang.github.io/webp-multi-versioning> to see online demo.
